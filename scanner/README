Quickstart:

1. type
   make <enter>

   this build the scanner and the P2 driver Java application

2. type
   make test <enter>
   this runs the P2 driver program on test.sim

This will produce an error like
1:1 INTLITERAL (10)
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Error: could not match input
	at Yylex.zzScanError(simple.jlex.java:463)
	at Yylex.next_token(simple.jlex.java:659)
	at P2.main(P2.java:48)


this is expected: YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE SIMPLE LANGUAGE LEXICAL
SPECIFICATION BY MODIFYING simple.jlex
Once your specification is correct make test must work.

Note: you definitely want to use additional test.sim test programs to
test your scanner!

Also: you must change P2.java so that all tokens of the language with
their attributes get printed out when running P2.



HOW TO SUBMIT:
once everything works, type
make submit
to create a zip file of your work and upload it to Moodle.
Check that unzipping and typing make works correctly from a clean
directory.
